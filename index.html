          <p>Anatidaephobia (pronounced anna-tidy-phobia) is a pervasive and irrational fear that you are being watched by a duck. A person with this rare phobia fears that somehow, somewhere a duck is watching their every move. It can become a disabling condition that stops a person from maintaining daily functions and can interfere with the person’s personal and social life as well as compromise their job responsibilities. Anatidaephobia is derived from the Greek word “anatidae” which means ducks, geese or swans and the word “phobos” which means fear. The underlying cause is still unknown but is surmised to be a result of childhood trauma, perhaps having once been attacked by waterfowl.</p>

          <p>Anatidaephobia or the fear of ducks might have sprung due to a negative or traumatic incident related to ducks or geese. Such birds are known to have violent tendencies and are often known to attack people without any provocation. Often, they swoop down to steal food or simply take a nip.</p>
          <p>A child might have directly or indirectly experienced such an episode. S/he might have experienced the flapping sound made by the bird’s large wings. This then causes it to feel vulnerable or fearful around ducks. Most cases of childhood phobias get resolved over time. However, in few cases, they persist into adulthood.</p>
