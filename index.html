            <p>Anatidaephobia (pronounced anna-tidy-phobia) is a pervasive and irrational fear that you are being watched by a duck. A person with this rare phobia fears that somehow, somewhere a duck is watching their every move. It can become a disabling condition that stops a person from maintaining daily functions and can interfere with the person’s personal and social life as well as compromise their job responsibilities. Anatidaephobia is derived from the Greek word “anatidae” which means ducks, geese or swans and the word “phobos” which means fear. The underlying cause is still unknown but is surmised to be a result of childhood trauma, perhaps having once been attacked by waterfowl.</p>

            <p>Anatidaephobia or the fear of ducks might have sprung due to a negative or traumatic incident related to ducks or geese. Such birds are known to have violent tendencies and are often known to attack people without any provocation. Often, they swoop down to steal food or simply take a nip.</p>
            <p>A child might have directly or indirectly experienced such an episode. S/he might have experienced the flapping sound made by the bird’s large wings. This then causes it to feel vulnerable or fearful around ducks. Most cases of childhood phobias get resolved over time. However, in few cases, they persist into adulthood.</p>

          <h2>Anatidaephilia</h2>
          <p>To every phobia is a sibling, a philia. Whereas a phobia is the irrational fear of something, a philia is the irrational love or fondness of it. Anatidaephilia is the irration hope that somehow a duck is watching you. This however, is much rarer than it's phobia counterpart and has rarely been seen outside the Anatidae family of fowl.</p>

          <h2>Anatidae</h2>
          <p>The Anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world's continents. These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 146 species in 40 genera. (The magpie goose is no longer considered to be part of the Anatidae, but is placed in its own family Anseranatidae.)</p>

          <h2>Phobia</h2>
          <p>A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder, defined by a persistent fear of an object or situation. The phobia typically results in a rapid onset of fear and is present for more than six months. The affected person will go to great lengths to avoid the situation or object, typically to a degree greater than the actual danger posed. If the feared object or situation cannot be avoided, the affected person will have significant distress. With blood or injury phobia, fainting may occur. Agoraphobia is often associated with panic attacks. Usually a person has phobias to a number of objects or situations.</p>
